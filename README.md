# RolePickerBot

RolePickerBot is a small Java project that connects to the Discord API through the library JDA (JAVA DISCORD API) and utilizes Interactions and SelectMenu's to give your members a option to choose their own roles.

This was made for fun. If you want a more functional Discord Bot software, check out [Ryder](https://github.com/nikoci/Ryder) or [RoboFlask](https://github.com/nikoci/RoboFlask) which are my other 2 projects I've made.
